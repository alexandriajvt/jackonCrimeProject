This is my Software Application project to keep track of crime reports in the Jackson Area
Violence in Jackson, Mississippi is a major problem. Jackson is Mississippi’s most violent city.

My solution is a software application that will allow Jackson citizens to report suspicious activities in their neighborhoods. 
User’s will be able to enter their address, area code, and send in a description of what they have seen. 
If their report helps to stop a crime, they will be compensated.
